## Project Overview
This project explores predictive analytics on historical Olympics data, focusing on:
- Predicting medal wins by analyzing athlete profiles.
- Forecasting country-level success in future Olympic events.
- Clustering athletes based on performance metrics to assist in talent identification.

The repository includes code for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model selection, training, and evaluation, built with Python and popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn.

## Project Goals
1. **Medal Prediction by Athlete Profile**: Predict medal outcomes by analyzing athlete attributes and historical data.
2. **Country Medal Success Prediction**: Forecast the success rate of countries in future Olympics based on historical trends.
3. **Athlete Performance Clustering**: Identify potential talent by clustering athletes based on performance metrics.

## Dataset Description
This project uses two primary datasets:

1. **Olympic_Athlete_Event_Results.csv**: Contains details of athletes’ participation and results across various events.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `Games`: Name of the Olympics event (e.g., 1972 Summer Olympics).
     - `edition_id`: Unique identifier for each Olympic edition.
     - `NOC`: National Olympic Committee code (e.g., USA for the United States).
     - `Sport` and `Event`: Specific sport and event within the Olympics (e.g., Athletics, Boxing).
     - `Name`: Athlete’s full name.
     - `pos`: Athlete’s position or outcome in the event.
     - `Medal`: Medal won (Gold, Silver, Bronze).
     - `isTeamSport`: Indicates if the sport was a team event.
     - `Height` and `Weight`: Physical attributes of the athlete (if available).
     - `Born`: Athlete’s date of birth.
     - `Country`: Athlete’s country.

2. **Olympic_Games_Medal_Tally.csv**: Aggregated country-level medal counts for each Olympic edition.
   - **Key Columns**:
     - `edition`: Name and year of the Olympics event.
     - `edition_id`: Unique identifier for each Olympic edition.
     - `Year`: Year of the Olympics.
     - `Country` and `country_noc`: Country name and NOC code.
     - `Gold`, `Silver`, `Bronze`, `Total`: Number of medals won by each country.

These datasets will support our goals by enabling analysis of athlete profiles, country performance trends, and cluster analysis.

## Workflow and Methodology
Our workflow is divided into four primary phases, handled by team members with dedicated roles.

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Understanding**: Familiarization with dataset attributes and characteristics.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Strategies for imputation or removal of null entries.
- **Normalization & Encoding**: Scaling numerical features and encoding categorical features.
- **Data Splitting**: Separation into training and testing sets.

### 2. Data Exploration & Feature Engineering
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data trends.
- **Feature Selection**: Correlation analysis and feature importance identification.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to enhance model performance.

### 3. Model Selection & Implementation
- **Model Research**: Identification of suitable machine learning algorithms.
- **Model Implementation**: Training classifiers like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization through grid/random search.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use of cross-validation techniques to improve model robustness.

### 4. Model Evaluation & Reporting
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
- **Error Analysis**: Analysis of misclassified instances and possible model improvements.
- **Visualization**: Final visualizations for results interpretation.
- **Report Compilation**: Documentation of findings and methodology.

## Work Division and Contributions

- **Member 1**: Data Preprocessing (e.g., dataset understanding, handling missing data, encoding, normalization, and data splitting).
- **Member 2**: Data Exploration & Feature Engineering (e.g., EDA, feature selection, visualization, and engineering).
- **Member 3**: Model Selection & Implementation (e.g., model research, training, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation).
- **Member 4**: Model Evaluation & Final Reporting (e.g., evaluation, error analysis, final reporting).

This division allows each member to dedicate 20 hours to key tasks, ensuring a balanced workload and comprehensive results.
